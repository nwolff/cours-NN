- Show what's being fed when training : Either as an overlay on the training zone, or as pixels on the network
- Disable buttons while automatic training is ongoing or queue them up. Maybe show current progress
  (this should also fix 4 tensor leaks)
- Timestamp in /about page is stuck (but the git hash is correct)
- Bug on firefox when training the Zalando model, the accuracy stays very low and the confusion matrix shows a single line, as if there was only one number shown. Two participants had this on firefox and the problem went away when they switched to chrome
